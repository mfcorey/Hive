## Notes
### Chapter 1
***Big Ideas***
* Install, upgrade, and migrate servers and workloads
* Install and configure Nano Server
* Create, manage, and maintain images for deployment

***Key Considerations when installing Server 2016***
* Which Windows Server 2016 should you install?
* Which installation option should you use? (Desktop or Server Core)
* What Roles and features do your servers need?
* What virtualiztion strategy should you use?

***Minimum Harware Requirements***
* Processor: 1.4-GHz 64-bit
* RAM: 512 MB ECC for Server Core, 2 GB ECC for Server with Desktop Experience
* Disk space: 32 GB minimum on a SATA or comparable drive
* Network adapter: Ethernet, with gigabit throughput
* Monitor: Super VGA (1024 x 768) or higher resolution
* Keyboard and mouse (or other compatible pointing device)
* Internet access

***Maximum hardware and virtualization limits***
* Processors A server host supports up to 512 logical processors (LPs) if Hyper-V is installed.
* Memory Up to 24 terabytes per host server and up to 12 terabytes per virtual machine.
* VHDX size Up to 64 terabytes.
* Virtual machines Up to 1,024 per host server.
* Virtual machine processors Up to 240 per virtual machine.

***Determine Appropriate Windows Server 2016 editions per workload***
* What roles and features will you need to run on the server?
* How will you obtain licenses for the servers?
* Will you be running physical or virtual machines?

*Nanno server was introduced when smallers servers sprouted in popularity. Rather than having one large server with many fuctions, it became more common to spread that our to smaller servers.* 

***Server Editions*** 
* ***Windows Server 2016 Datacenter***
*Intended for large and powerfull servers in a highly virtualized environment. The license allows for an unlimited amount of operating systems environments (OSEs) or Hyper-V containers. The Datacenter edition also includes additional features not available in the other editions, such as Storage Spaces Direct, Storage Replica, shielded virtual machines, and a new networking stack with additional virtualization options.*
* ***Windows Server 2016 Standard***
*The Standard edition license allows for two OSEs and includes the same core set of features as the Datacenter edition. However, it lacks the new storage and networking features listed in the Datacenter description.*
* ***Windows Server 2016 Essentials***
*The Essentials edition includes nearly all the features in the Standard and Datacenter editions; it does not include the Server Core installation option. The Essentials edition is also limited to one OSE (physical or virtual) and a maximum of 25 users and 50 devices. Unlike the Standard and Datacenter editions, Essential includes a confi guration wizard that installs and confi gures Active Directory Domain Services and other essential components needed for a single-server network.*
* ***Windows Server 2016 MultiPoint Premium Server***
* ***Windows Storage Server 2016 Server***
* ***Windows Hyper-V Server 2016***

***Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Additon (Features)***
* ***Storage Spaces Direct*** *Enables administrators to use relatively inexpensive drive arrays to create high-availability storage solutions. Instead of using an expensive array or controller with built-in storage management intelligence, the intelligence is incorporated into the operating system, enabling the use of inexpensive JBOD (just a bunch of disks) arrays*
* ***Storage Replica*** *Provides storage-agnostic, synchronous or asynchronous volume replication between local or remote servers, using the Server Message Blocks Version 3 protocol.*
* ***Shilded Vitual Machines*** *Provides VMs with protection from compromised
administrators that have access to the Hyper-V host computer by encrypting the VM
state and its virtual disks.*
* ***Network Controller*** *Provides a central automation point for network infrastructure configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.*
